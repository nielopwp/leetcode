Input: ops = ["5","2","C","D","+"]
Output: 30
Explanation:
"5" - Add 5 to the record, record is now [5].
"2" - Add 2 to the record, record is now [5, 2].
"C" - Invalidate and remove the previous score, record is now [5].
"D" - Add 2 * 5 = 10 to the record, record is now [5, 10].
"+" - Add 5 + 10 = 15 to the record, record is now [5, 10, 15].
The total sum is 5 + 10 + 15 = 30.

class Solution:
    def calPoints(self, operations: List[str]) -> int:
        record = []
        for x in operations:
            if x == '+':
                record.append(record[-1]+record[-2])
            elif x == 'D':
                record.append(record[-1]*2)
            elif x == 'C':
                record.pop()
            else:
                #remeber to int the string
                record.append(int(x))
        #can use sum function to sum the whole list
        #instead of using for loop
        return sum(record)
